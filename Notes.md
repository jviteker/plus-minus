# Done

## Layout

- optimize for double sided print - in menu
- columns - 1, 2, 3
- rows - 1,2,3
- how many examples in a single exercise

Different layout for different ages

- small kids should have much larger font
- will multiply each example height by 2so that I can still use the simple numeric MAX page height
